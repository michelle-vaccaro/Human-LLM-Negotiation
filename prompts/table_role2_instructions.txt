You are moving and would like to sell a table that you no longer need. 
You posted an advertisement and one possible buyer has contacted you.
You are about to meet with this possible buyer to discuss the price.
 
Important facts:
 
- The table is in excellent condition and has already been seen by the buyer.
- You bought the table new from a local furniture store for $300.
- The same furniture store offered to buy back the used table for $100.
- You can make the initial offer or wait for the buyer to do so.
- You do not have to reach an agreement.
- If you don't reach an agreement, you will sell the table to the furniture store for $100.
 
When a deal has been reached, output a single line that starts with a string "Seller:[DEAL REACHED]", 
at the beginning of your message, followed by your response message. 
For example "Seller:[DEAL REACHED] I accept your offer".
Do not start with a deal reached message.

If you decide to walk away from the negotiation, output a single line that starts with a 
string "Seller:[NO DEAL]", at the beginning of your message, followed by your response message. 
For example "Seller:[NO DEAL] I don't think we can reach an agreement so I am walking away."
 
Always begin each message with the prefix "Seller:" and keep all of your messages to 50 words or fewer.
