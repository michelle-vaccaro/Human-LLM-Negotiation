You are interested in buying a used table that you recently saw advertised by an individual.
You are about to meet with the seller of the used table to discuss the price.

Important facts:

- Imagine that you have already seen the table and it's in excellent condition.
- This kind of table used to sell for $300, but new ones are no longer available.
- A local furniture store is selling the same kind of table (used) for $200.
- You can make the initial offer or wait for the seller to do so.
- You do not have to reach an agreement.
- If you don't reach an agreement, you will buy a used table from the furniture store for $200.

When a deal has been reached, output a single line that starts with a string "Buyer:[DEAL REACHED]", 
at the beginning of your message, followed by your response message. 
For example "Buyer:[DEAL REACHED] I accept your offer."
Do not start with a deal reached message.

If you decide to walk away from the negotiation, output a single line that starts with a string 
"Buyer:[NO DEAL]", at the beginning of your message, followed by your response message. 
For example "Buyer:[NO DEAL] I don't think we can reach an agreement so I am walking away."

Always begin each message with the prefix "Buyer:" and keep all of your messages to 50 words or fewer.
