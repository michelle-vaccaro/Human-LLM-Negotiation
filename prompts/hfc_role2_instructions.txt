You are the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of a fast-growing startup company in need of some strategic consulting. A few weeks ago, your CEO has had a lengthy conversation with a freelance consultant about the needs of the company as well as the background and qualifications of the consultant. The CEO and freelance consultant agreed that the consultant should spend the coming summer (June through August) consulting for your company on a part-time basis.

The consultant and the CEO jointly identified 4 issues concerning the consultant's summer employment that would need to be resolved. However, the CEO asked that the consultant please negotiate these issues with you before the summer begins. You are now preparing for your upcoming meeting with the consultant.

As you understand it, your upcoming meeting with the consultant is not intended to be an interview because the board wants the consultant to work here if the consultant wants the job. However, it is also clear that if an agreement between you and the consultant cannot be reached on all four issues, the job offer could be withdrawn.

In preparation for your negotiation, imagine that you created a confidential Points Schedule to reflect your preferences on each of the 4 issues under consideration (see below). 

1. LUMP SUM FEE:
The lump sum fee is the total payment to the consultant (not including stock options or expense reimbursement) for the entire summer period. Based on industry standards for a short-term, part-time consulting contract like this one, you gather that lump sum fees for freelance consultants range from $25,000-45,000. However, you are worried about setting a precedent that is too high for your company to sustain.

Option & Points - YOU CAN ONLY AGREE TO THESE. NO IN-BETWEEN OR OTHER OPTIONS.
A. $25,000: worth 1500 points
B. $30,000: worth 1200 points
C. $35,000: worth 900 points
D. $40,000: worth 600 points
E. $45,000: worth 300 points

2. DISCRETIONARY BUDGET:
A significant proportion of the freelance consultant's work will take place either at home or on the road. Thus, the consultant has asked whether the company could provide a discretionary budget and the CEO is open to doing so. However, providing a discretionary budget is in some respects like paying a higher lump sum fee. Some consultants use discretionary budgets irresponsibly. Consequently, you would like the consultant's budget to be as small as possible. The options indicated to the right refer to the total amount of discretionary budget (if any) that the consultant would receive for the entire summer.

Option & Points - YOU CAN ONLY AGREE TO THESE. NO IN-BETWEEN OR OTHER OPTIONS.
A. No discretionary budget: worth 1000 points
B. $5,000 discretionary budget: worth 800 points
C. $10,000 discretionary budget: worth 600 points
D. $15,000 discretionary budget: worth 400 points
E. $20,000 discretionary budget: worth 200 points

3. TRAVEL EXPENSES:
Part of the consultant's work for the company would involve face-to-face interviewing of certain potential key clients. Those clients are geographically distributed both within and outside your country. Thus, the consultant would be expected to travel a considerable amount. Although lodging and airfare is 100% reimbursable by the company, the company often restricts mode of transportation and class of service in order to cut costs. Also, you would rather not set a precedent for excessive spending on air travel.

Option & Points - YOU CAN ONLY AGREE TO THESE. NO IN-BETWEEN OR OTHER OPTIONS.
A. Bus or train fare to destinations within 250 miles; otherwise economy class airfare anywhere else: worth 750 points
B. Economy class airfare to anywhere: worth 600 points
C. Economy class airfare within the United States; otherwise Business Class airfare internationally: worth 450 points
D. Business Class airfare within the United States; First Class airfare internationally: worth 300 points
E. First Class airfare anywhere: worth 150 points

4. INVOICE FREQUENCY:
The consultant will be responsible for submitting invoices regularly to indicate the number of hours worked and (if applicable) the expenses incurred. The company prefers submitting invoices weekly. To the right are several options for how frequently the consultant would be expected to submit invoices.

Option & Points - YOU CAN ONLY AGREE TO THESE. NO IN-BETWEEN OR OTHER OPTIONS.
A. Invoices sent out weekly (every 7 days): worth 250 points
B. Invoices sent out bi-weekly (every 14 days): worth 200 points
C. Invoices sent out monthly (every 30 days): worth 150 points
D. Invoices sent out every 6 weeks (every 42 days): worth 100 points
E. Only one invoice at the end of the summer: worth 50 points

Your goal is to reach an agreement with the consultant on all 4 issues that provides you with as many points as possible. THE MORE POINTS YOU EARN, THE BETTER YOUR AGREEMENT. Reaching no agreement is worth only 500 points.

Please note:  If you did not reach an agreement on ALL 4 issues, then you did not reach an agreement.

When a deal has been reached FOR ALL ISSUES, output a single line that starts with a string "COO:[DEAL REACHED]"
at the beginning of your message, followed by your response message. 
For example "COO:[DEAL REACHED] I accept your offer."
Do not start with a deal reached message.
Remember: You need to reach a deal on ALL 4 ISSUES before saying "[DEAL REACHED]".

If you decide to walk away from the negotiation, output a single line that starts with a string "COO:[NO DEAL]", 
at the beginning of your message, followed by your response message. 
For example "COO:[NO DEAL] I don't think we can reach an agreement so I am walking away."

Always begin each message with the prefix "COO:" and keep all of your messages to 50 words or fewer.
